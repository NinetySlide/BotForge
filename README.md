## Overview

**BotForge** is a light framework that allows you to easily create Facebook Messenger Bots. It uses basic Java HTTP Servlets under the hood and has no dependencies other than Gson, so that you can deploy it on your favorite Servlet Container, either in the cloud or on-premises.

BotForge takes care of handling the interaction with the Facebook API and saves you writing a lot of boilerplate code. It exposes a simple event based API for message reception, automatically handles basic functionalities (e.g. webhook validation and signature verification) and provides facilities to manage the received messages, the sending of new messages and the querying of the User Profile API. It also has out-of-the-box the ability to impersonate multiple bots with the same code (more on this later).

Creating a HelloBot that greets users by calling them with their name is as simple as writing a few lines of code:

```java
public class HelloBot extends FbBot {
    
    @Override
    protected BotContext onContextLoad(String pageId, String webhookUrl) {
        return new BotContext(
                PAGE_ID,
                PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
                APP_SECRET_KEY,
                VERIFY_TOKEN,
                WEBHOOK_URL
        );
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onMessageReceived(BotContext context, ReceivedMessage message) {
        String userId = message.getSenderId();
        String pageAccessToken = context.getPageAccessToken();
        
        SendMessageAdapter.sendTextMessage(
                pageAccessToken,
                "Hello " + UserProfileApiAdapter.getUserProfile(pageAccessToken, userId).getFirstName() + "!",
                userId
        );
    }
    
}
```

Let's analyze the code above: 
* On line 1, the `FbBot` class is extended. This class is the abstract class the every bot shall extend.
* On line 4, the callback for loading bot context objects is overridden. Whenever BotForge needs a bot context and can't find it in the cache, it will invoke the `onContextLoad()` callback so that the right bot context can be created (if needed) and returned.
* On line 5, a new `BotContext` object is created and returned, using all the relevant information about the bot.
* On line 15, the callback for message receiving is overridden. Whenever a message is received from a user, BotForge will invoke the `onMessageReceived()` callback passing as arguments the message sent from the user and the bot context object of the bot that received the message.
* On line 16, the Sender ID is extracted from the received message. This will become the Recipient ID for the new message.
* On line 17, the Page Access Token is extracted from the bot context passed as an argument. This will be used to send a message to the user. 
* On line 19, a new basic text message is sent to the user using the Page Access Token, the String representing the text message and the User ID.
* On line 21, the User Profile API is queried to retrieve the first name of the user.

## BotForge Internals
In BotForge the `FbBot` class is the superclass that shall be extended by every bot's main class (the one that will handle the incoming messages). The `FbBot` class, in turn, extends the `HttpServlet` class. So you have to configure the deployment descriptor of your app (most likely the web.xml file) to use the bot's main class as the servlet for the URL you have chosen as your bot's webhook.

### Webhook handling
The `doPost()` method of the `FbBot` class will receive all the messages that the Facebook servers will send to the webhook of your bot. These messages are in the form of HTTP POST requests, carrying data in JSON format.
 
A request can carry user's messages or other message-related events, such as postbacks, delivery receipts, read receipts, etc. 

Moreover, each request can batch together multiple messages to optimize resource usage (e.g. in case of heavy load). BotForge can handle all these events seamlessly.
  
Whenever a message is received from the Facebook servers, BotForge will first try to load the context of the bot that is receiving the message (more on this later) based on the URL used by the Facebook servers. After that, BotForge will go through all the messages of the batch and for each one of them will determine its type, create the right POJO with the content extracted from the message and, finally, will invoke the right callback passing the bot context and the newly created POJO.
  
In BotForge there are a number of callbacks that you can override to handle all the possible events that can be generated by the bot activity. 

For example, to handle the reception of user's messages you can override the `onMessageReceived()` callback. This way, every time a user sends a message to your bot, your implementation of `onMessageReceived` will be called by BotForge and you will have access to the `BotContext` object and to the `ReceivedMessage` object. Similarly, you can override `onPostbackReceived` callback to handle the postbacks from your users, and so on.
 
It's important to notice that all this callbacks have a default implementation that does just nothing, so you are free to override only the callbacks related to the events that you are really interested to handle, leaving out the rest.

You can find the complete list of callbacks by looking at the JavaDocs of the `FbBot` class.
