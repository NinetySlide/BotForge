## Overview

**BotForge** is a light framework that allows you to easily create Facebook Messenger Bots. It uses basic Java HTTP Servlets under the hood and has no dependencies other than Gson, so that you can deploy it on your favorite Servlet Container, either in the cloud or on-premises.

BotForge takes care of handling the interaction with the Facebook API and saves you writing a lot of boilerplate code. It exposes a simple event based API for message reception, automatically handles basic functionalities (e.g. webhook validation and signature verification) and provides facilities to manage the received messages, the sending of new messages and the querying of the User Profile API. It also has out-of-the-box the ability to impersonate multiple bots with the same code (more on this later).

Creating a HelloBot that greets users by calling them with their name is as simple as writing a few lines of code:

```java
public class HelloBot extends FbBot {
    
    @Override
    protected BotContext onContextLoad(String pageId, String webhookUrl) {
        return new BotContext(
                PAGE_ID,
                PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
                APP_SECRET_KEY,
                VERIFY_TOKEN,
                WEBHOOK_URL
        );
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onMessageReceived(BotContext context, ReceivedMessage message) {
        String userId = message.getSenderId();
        String pageAccessToken = context.getPageAccessToken();
        
        SendMessageAdapter.sendTextMessage(
                pageAccessToken,
                "Hello " + UserProfileApiAdapter.getUserProfile(pageAccessToken, userId).getFirstName() + "!",
                userId
        );
    }
    
}
```

Let's analyze the code above: 
* On line 1, the `FbBot` class is extended. This class is the abstract class the every bot shall extend.
* On line 4, the callback for loading bot context objects is overridden. Whenever BotForge needs a bot context and can't find it in the cache, it will invoke the `onContextLoad()` callback so that the right bot context can be created (if needed) and returned.
* On line 5, a new `BotContext` object is created and returned, using all the relevant information about the bot.
* On line 15, the callback for message receiving is overridden. Whenever a message is received from a user, BotForge will invoke the `onMessageReceived()` callback passing as arguments the message sent from the user and the bot context object of the bot that received the message.
* On line 16, the Sender ID is extracted from the received message. This will become the Recipient ID for the new message.
* On line 17, the Page Access Token is extracted from the bot context passed as an argument. This will be used to send a message to the user. 
* On line 19, a new basic text message is sent to the user using the Page Access Token, the String representing the text message and the User ID.
* On line 21, the User Profile API is queried to retrieve the first name of the user.

## BotForge Internals
In BotForge the `FbBot` class is the superclass that shall be extended by every bot's main class (the one that will handle the incoming messages). The `FbBot` class, in turn, extends the `HttpServlet` class. So you have to configure the deployment descriptor of your app (most likely the web.xml file) to use the bot's main class as the servlet for the URL you have chosen as your bot's webhook.

### Webhook handling
The `doPost()` method of the `FbBot` class will receive all the messages that the Facebook servers will send to the webhook of your bot. These messages are in the form of HTTP POST requests, carrying data in JSON format.
 
A request can carry user's messages or other message-related events, such as postbacks, delivery receipts, read receipts, etc. 

Moreover, each request can batch together multiple messages to optimize resource usage (e.g. in case of heavy load). BotForge can handle all these events seamlessly.
  
Whenever a message is received from the Facebook servers, BotForge will first try to load the context of the bot that is receiving the message (more on this later) based on the URL used by the Facebook servers. After that, BotForge will go through all the messages of the batch and for each one of them will determine its type, create the right POJO with the content extracted from the message and, finally, will invoke the right callback passing the bot context and the newly created POJO.
  
In BotForge there are a number of callbacks that you can override to handle all the possible events that can be generated by the bot activity. 

For example, to handle the reception of user's messages you can override the `onMessageReceived()` callback. This way, every time a user sends a message to your bot, your implementation of `onMessageReceived` will be called by BotForge and you will have access to the `BotContext` object and to the `ReceivedMessage` object. Similarly, you can override `onPostbackReceived` callback to handle the postbacks from your users, and so on.
 
It's important to notice that all this callbacks have a default implementation that does just nothing, so you are free to override only the callbacks related to the events that you are really interested to handle, leaving out the rest.

You can find the complete list of callbacks by looking at the JavaDocs of the `FbBot` class.

### Incoming Messages
As stated before, each incoming messaging event has a POJO that models it and can hold its content. All of them have `IncomingMessage` as the common superclass. This means that for every messaging event you can access its Sender ID, Recipient ID and Timestamp via getter methods. 

Of course, you can have access to the data of a specific message type using the appropriate getter method for that message. For example, you can use `getPayload()` to get the payload of a `Postback` message, `getAttachment()` to get the attachment of an `IncomingAttachmentMessage`, or `getText()` to get the text of an `IncomingTextMessage`.
 
You can find the complete list of POJOs for incoming messaging events and their getter methods by looking at the JavaDocs of BotForge.

### Outgoing Messages
One of the main feature of a chat bot is, obviously, to send chat messages. The Facebook Messenger Platform supports a certain number of message types which can be further customized adding things like quick replies, notification options, etc. You can find a complete description of all the supported message types and the allowed options by looking at the [official documentation of the Send API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference).

BotForge has a simple and unified interface to create every kind of outgoing message with every kind of possible customization. You can use a builder to create the desired type of message and then use that builder to customize it. When you are done, you will get an instance of `OutgoingMessage` object that is ready to be sent. 

In order to create a new `OutgoingMessage` you have to create a new instance of `OutgoingMessage.Builder` object, passing the message type to the constructor. You can then use the builder's public methods to customize your message. When you are done, just invoke the `build()` method to get yout message. Please note that if you try to customize you message in ways that are not supported by the message type, an exception will be thrown.

Here is an example for creating a template message with quick replies.

```java
Bubble bubble = new Bubble().setTitle("Example Bubble").setImageUrl("http://example.com/bubble.jpg");

OutgoingMessage.QuickReply quickReply1 = new OutgoingMessage.QuickReply("Action 1", "act1");
OutgoingMessage.QuickReply quickReply2 = new OutgoingMessage.QuickReply("Action 2", "act2");
   
OutgoingMessage.Builder builder = new OutgoingMessage.Builder(OutgoingMessageType.TEMPLATE_GENERIC);
    
OutgoingMessage message = builder.addBubble(bubble)
    .addQuickReply(quickReply1)
    .addQuickReply(quickReply2)
    .build();
```

You can find the complete list of option for the builder by looking at the JavaDocs of the `OutgoingMessage.Builder` class.  

### Send Message Adapter
Once you have the OutgoingMessage, you can send it using the `sendMessage()` static method of the `SendMessageAdapter` class.

In order to use that method, you will need two things other that the message you have just created: the Page Access Token for your bot and an instance of `OutgoingMessage.OutgoingRecipient` object.

The Page Access Token can be extracted from the `BotContext` object of your bot. As a reminder, this object is passed as an argument of every webhook-related callback.
 
The recipient object can be created using the appropriate constructor. Please note that you can use a User ID or a telephone number in the constructor, but not both. If you are willing to use telephone numbers as recipient, make sure you are allowed by Facebook to do so, otherwise you will get an error in response to the message sending. 

The `sendMessage()` method will perform a synchronous HTTP request to the Facebook servers, will deliver the message and will return the response of the Facebook servers in the form of a `SendMessageResponse` object. You can inspect this object to check for errors or to get the response-related information.

You can send the same `OutgoingMessage` to multiple recipients by using the overloaded version of the `sendMessage()` method that will accept an array of `OutgoingMessage.OutgoingRecipient` objects as the third parameter. You will get an array of `SendMessageResponse` objects that will match the order of the recipients in the array. 

Please note that this method will perform a synchronous HTTP request to the Facebook servers for each recipient. So if you have constraints about the execution time of your code in your environment it's better to call this method in a different thread (or in a task queue) or, at least, limit the number of recipient to a minimum.

If you just want to send basic messages, the `SendMessageAdapter` offers a collection of methods that will let you do so without having to create the message with a builder. There is one of these methods for each message type. For example, to send a basic text message all you need is this code:
```
SendMessageAdapter.sendTextMessage(
    PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    "Hi, this is a sample message",
    "RECIPIENT_ID"
);
```
Every one of these methods has an overloaded version that will allow you to send the message to multiple recipients. Please note that this way you can only send messages using User IDs.

### Message Converter
BotForge offers a facility to convert a message received from a user into an `OutgoingMessage`. This can be useful in case you want to forward messages you receive.

To do so, just call the `getOutgoingMessage()` static method of the `MessageConverter` class, passing as an argument the instance of the message you received via the `onMessageReceived()` callback.

### User Profile API Adapter
BotForge also offers an adapter to query the Facebook's User Profile API. 

If you want to retrieve information about a user, all you need to do is invoking the `getUserProfile()` static method of the `UserProfileApiAdapter` class, passing the User ID as an argument. This method will perform a synchronous HTTP request to the Facebook servers in order to retrieve the desired user profile. This profile will be returned in the form of a `UserProfile` object. You can access user's information via the getter methods of that object.

### Bot Contexts and BotContextManager

### Webhook Validation

### Signature
Unless you specify to do otherwise in the `BotContext` object of your bot, BotForge will check the signature of every message received from the Facebook servers. This is done by using the App Secret Key contained in the context.

If the verification fails, an error will be returned as the response of the HTTP request and the message will not be processed.
